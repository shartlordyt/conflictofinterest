<h1> REALLY COOL DOC ABOUT NOKNOK N STUFFS! </h1>

<p> ok so ur wondering what this is. this is a q / a AND  tutorial on how to make simple html docs with games. so lets start! </p>

<h1> Who are you? </h1>
<p> uhmm. amateur "dev" who made noknok once for funsies. </p>
<h1> Where can I contact you? </h1>
<p> i dont really use socials for  my coding stuff, if ya wanna talk about it just find me in person (if ya know me irl :] ) </p>
<h1> Why the name NokNok??? </h1>
<p> the  site was named after the noknok shell from mario rpg. </p>


And now for the tutorial!

First ya wanna open up a text document 

then ya wanna paste this code in:

  <p> &lt; embed width="1200px" height="650px" src="https://placeholder.com" &gt;  &lt; /embed &gt; </p>
 
 but replace the placeholder.com with the site you want unblocked . 
 The site has to have https instead of http or it wont work.
 some sites dont allow embeds, https://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker can check for these sites.
 sites that dont allow embeds are usually big ones like google and twitter. 
 then you want to save your doc as (insert title here).html
 if it doesnt end in .html it will not work.
 
 thanks and see ya
